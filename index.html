<div id="bio">
    <p>
      I was born in Shemelba, Ethiopia. My family moved to the United States when I was one. We first moved to Chicago, Illinois, but moved to Seattle and later Edmonds, Washington.
      Growing up , I loved to play outside and play sports. I was involved in basketball, volleybal, track and field, and cross country. As I continue to grow older, I love to learn and explore different things.
      I always had a fun time at Robotics and Math Team meetings because they were always a great place to learn and ask questions.
      Also, throughout high school I have fostered a passion for adovacy and social justice and have been involved with the BSU and the Diversity Club at my school.

<div id="free_time">
    <p>
      On my free time, I love to bake, cook, and hang out with my friends. I
      love to take walks, hikes, and do yoga as well. I like biking and want to bike from Seattle to Portland one day!
     On my free time, watching a movie and hanging out with my family is really important to me. I love to read books and listen to podcast on my free time as well. Currrently, I am reading <i>I am Malala</i> by Malala Yousafzai
      and <i>Between the World and Me</i> by Ta-Nehisi Coates. My favorite podcast is Code Switch from NPR. Lastly, I love spending my free time planning and gardening with my family.
